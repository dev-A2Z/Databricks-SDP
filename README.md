# Databricks Spark Declarative Pipelines
A rapidly growing cab service company is facing problems with late data and inefficient views across all cities. Regional managers are complaining that they aren't receiving data on time, and that their dashboards are difficult to use. Their platform relies on procedural Spark pipelines and manual orchestration, which are slow to adapt to regional requirements. This project showcases how Databricks' Lakeflow Spark declarative pipelines can help improve efficiency.
